<!-- 14h30-15h30 lecture part (this could already drift towards the practical part but doesn't have to ...) -->

<!-- 15:30-16h00 coffee break -->

<!-- 16h00-17h00 hands-on workshop (could be somewhat open-ended, we'll have the room all afternoon - but if we would go into extra time, we should make a short 'cut' around 17h such that those who have/want to go home can do so). -->

<!-- Sally: see it as an opportunity - vital for change -->

<!-- Lucy: Propensity to cycle tool -->

<!-- It's brilliant, magic, helps imagine what the future could be like -->
